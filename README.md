### Troubleshooting:

You may encounter some issues during index creation with chromadb due to Sqlite3. [Chroma requires SQLite > 3.35](https://docs.trychroma.com/troubleshooting#sqlite), if you encounter issues with having too low of a SQLite version please try the following:

- Install pysqlite3-binary, `pip install pysqlite3-binary` and then override the default sqlite3 library before running Chroma by following the steps mentioned [here](https://gist.github.com/defulmere/8b9695e415a44271061cc8e272f3c300?permalink_comment_id=4650539#gistcomment-4650539).
